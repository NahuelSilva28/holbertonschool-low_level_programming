# Malloc and Free

malloc and free are two important functions in C programming language for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

malloc is used to allocate memory dynamically during program execution, and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block. It takes the number of bytes to be allocated as an argument.

free is used to deallocate the memory block previously allocated by malloc and other related functions. It takes a pointer to the memory block to be deallocated as an argument.

It's important to manage dynamic memory properly using malloc and free to prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues in a program.
