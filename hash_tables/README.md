## Hash Tables

Hash tables are a data structure used for efficient data retrieval and storage. They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for constant-time lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

In a hash table, collisions can occur when two different keys are mapped to the same index. There are several strategies for handling collisions, such as chaining or open addressing.

Hash tables are commonly used in programming languages, databases, and web applications for tasks such as caching, indexing, and storing data.

To use a hash table, you typically need to define a hash function that maps keys to indices in the array, as well as handle collisions and resizing as needed. Some programming languages, such as Python and Java, have built-in hash table implementations.
