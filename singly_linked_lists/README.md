### Singly linked lists

A singly linked list is a data structure used in computer science to store a sequence of elements, where each element (or node) contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node points to a null value, indicating the end of the list.

In C programming language, a singly linked list can be implemented using a struct that has two members: a data member to store the element value, and a pointer member to store the address of the next node in the list.

Here is an example of a singly linked list node implementation in C:

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

To create a singly linked list in C, we can use a combination of dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation to allocate memory for each node and connect them together.

Overall, singly linked lists are useful for situations where we need to frequently insert or delete elements from the middle of a list, since these operations can be performed in constant time with proper pointer manipulation. However, singly linked lists have slower random access time compared to arrays or doubly linked lists.
